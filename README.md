The original Wisconsin-Breast Cancer (Diagnostics) dataset (WBC) from UCI machine learning repository is a classification dataset, which records the measurements for breast cancer cases. There are two classes, benign and malignant. The malignant class of this dataset is downsampled to 21 points, which are considered as outliers, while points in the benign class are considered inliers.
